        <p>Definition of Operators <span class="clickable1">Click here</span> to hide the definition.</p>
        <p>Operators that require one operand are called unary operators. ... The value and its type depends on the operator and
        the type of its operands. For example, the arithmetic operators (perform basic arithmetic operations such as
        addition and subtraction) return numbers--typically the result of the arithmetic operation.

        <p> In mathematics, a variable is a symbol or letter, such as "x" or "y," that represents a value. In algebraic equations,
        the value of one variable is often dependent on the value of another. ... Variables are also used in computer
        programming to store specific values within a program

        readable?, is it writable?) In JavaScript, all attributes can be read, but only the value attribute can be changed
        (and only if the property is writable).
